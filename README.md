# Statistical analysis of Stroop Effect

Statistics is the science of decisions. This project aims to analyze statistical significance of a psychological occurrence called Stroop Effect by analysing data collected from an experiment. It illustrates the steps involved in statistical analysis. Follow this [link](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/bonamprabhu/stroop-effect/blob/master/statistical-analysis.html) to view the HTML output.

## Try out the experiment

Try out the Stroop task for yourself. Go to [this link](https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/java/ready.html), which has a Java-based 
applet for performing the Stroop task. Record the times that you received on the task (you need not submit your times to the site).
Analysis shared in this project is based on a dataset which contains results from a number of participants. Each row of the dataset 
contains the performance of one participant, with the first number representing their results on the congruent task and the second number 
representing their performance on the incongruent task. The dataset is named _stroopdata.csv_
